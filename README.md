#Repsheet Vizualizer [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/repsheet/visualizer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/repsheet/visualizer?branch=master)

This is the visualization component for Repsheet. It displays information on offending actors and allows for manual blacklisting. It provides a world map that displays the location of offending actors which allows for identification of global attack patterns. It is still under active development and will undergo some pretty major changes over the next several months.
